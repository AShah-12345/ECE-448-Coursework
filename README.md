# ECE-448-Coursework
MP (Machine Problems) from ECE 448: Artifical Intelligence @ UIUC FA'24

Brief Overview:

MP1:

Naive Bayes Classifier

This project contains a Python implementation of a Naive Bayes classifier for text classification tasks. The primary focus of this script is to train and predict text labels based on a dataset of reviews, using Laplace smoothing and a prior probability for classification. Code can be found in naive_bayes.py.

MP2:

Bigram Naive Bayes Classifier

This project features a Python implementation of a Bigram Naive Bayes classifier for text classification. This enhanced model incorporates both unigrams and bigrams to improve classification accuracy, utilizing Laplace smoothing for both unigrams and bigrams, and a mixture model to balance their contributions. Code can be found in bigram_naive_bayes.py
